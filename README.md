Assignment: Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping and Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning

This assignment covers basic TensorFlow operations, including tensor creation, reshaping, and broadcasting. Additionally, loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) were computed and compared.

Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping
Create a Random Tensor of Shape (4, 6): A random tensor was created with values between 1 and 10.

Find Rank and Shape: The rank (2) and shape (4, 6) of the tensor were computed using TensorFlow functions.

Reshape and Transpose: The tensor was reshaped into (2, 3, 4) and transposed to (3, 2, 4).

Broadcast a Smaller Tensor: A smaller tensor (1, 4) was broadcasted to match the shape of the larger tensor and added.

Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning
Define True Values and Predictions: True values and model predictions were defined.

Compute Losses: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) losses were computed and compared.

Modify Predictions: Predictions were modified, and the losses were recomputed.

Plot Loss Values: A bar chart was plotted to compare the MSE and CCE losses.
